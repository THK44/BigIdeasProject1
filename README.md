# BigIdeasProject1 - Program henceforth known as "Fun Fact".
The "Fun Fact" is intended to have both the user and the programmer tell a fun fact about themselves. 

# Running the Code

name = "Insert your name: "
funfact = "Insert a fun fact about yourself:  "
myfact = "My fun fact is that I can play piano."

input1 = input(name)
input2 = input(funfact)

print("Hello " + input1 + "!")
print(myfact)
print("Your fun fact is that: " + input2 + ". Cool!")
